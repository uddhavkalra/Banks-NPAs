# Banks-NPAs
## Undergraduate thesis
Research question: Did Demonetization and COVID-19 led to a rise in banks’ Non-Performing Assets1, (NPAs) and if so, through which channels is this rise driven.

## Data
I used data from RBI’s Database on the Indian Economy (DBIE), Razorpays’ Github and Nishusharma 1608’s Github. From DBIE, I use the Variables to be Published Bank and Bank Group-wise (For Public Access). From Razorpays’ Github, I use bank branch locations and from Nishusharma1608’s Github, I use census population data.

## Data Cleaning
Will update this section
